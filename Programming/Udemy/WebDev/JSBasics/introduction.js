// JavaScript is a high-level, versatile programming language.

// It is primarily used to create dynamic, interactive content on websites.

// At first it was only executed in a web console.

// It didn't have a proper "compiler".

// The solution to this, was V8, the Google engine that can run JS.

// Using V8, NodeJS came to life, and now it's a proper programming language with a JS environment.

// JavaScript can do: Frontend (JS), Backend (NodeJS), Desktop apps (Electron), Mobile apps (React Native).
